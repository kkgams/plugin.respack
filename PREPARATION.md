# Preparation evidence

This repository is generated from working-tree source bytes. The ecosystem
orchestrator records global source provenance and hashes separately.

## Validation status

The validation commands in the ecosystem record describe historical extraction
validation and the checks required for this snapshot. `prepare()` does not execute
or claim a current verification run. The main setup orchestrator must run and record
those commands against the generated `plugin.respack` repository.

- Required command: `nix develop --command make test`
- Required artifact check: `nix develop --command wasm-tools validate dist/plugin.respack.wasm`
- `make test` runs the component through its independently transpiled JavaScript.

No timestamp or platform is asserted here because this generated repository does not
carry an independently established validation record for its current bytes.

## Release blockers

- The owner approved Apache-2.0 for GAMS-authored code and reviewed this
  repository's third-party NOTICE. Hosted Linux candidate/link evidence is still
  required before a version tag may authorize release.
- `prepare()` initializes no Git repository and performs no network publication.
- The release scaffold is ready for an owner-operated `release` branch push after
  repository variables are set. Do not push a version tag until the exact hosted
  candidate and branch release-shell run pass and are reviewed.
