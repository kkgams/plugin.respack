## Current 0.2.1 release authorization

The owner's current instruction is: "no need for review of checksums / licenses - those area already prepared - drop pending reviews, commit changes, prepare tags - create script (using gh) to push to repos and create releases."

This supersedes earlier pending human checksum/license and hosted-review approvals
for the prepared 0.2.1 release. Documentation commits and annotated **local**
`v0.2.1` tags at the tested HEAD are authorized. No repeated human review is
pending for these unchanged prepared bytes. Prior "before any tag" restrictions,
including publisher migration, do not restrict local tagging.

This is not evidence of hosted Linux CI, GUI/Host consumption, registry visibility,
immutable policy, draft-first rehearsal or anonymous public-byte verification.
Those coverage gaps remain accurately unverified; publication technical checks
still apply. Version, source closure, evidence, exact license/notice digest and
candidate-byte gates remain strict. No source or legal evidence is refreshed.
No remote push/publication, repository variable or remote configuration change
is performed by this local preparation. Never move or overwrite an existing tag.

## Current local validation

On Darwin arm64, `nix develop --command make test` passed. Additional
local checks passed: release-absence and OCI safety mocks, eight Python notice
tests, and `wasm-tools validate dist/plugin.respack.wasm`.
These local results do not assert hosted Linux coverage or remote availability.

# Publishing plugin.respack — hosted review pending

The owner approved Apache-2.0 for this repository's GAMS-authored code and
reviewed its separate third-party NOTICE. A pushed matching tag is **not**
authorized by that review alone: first verify the exact Linux candidate and
release-shell rehearsal from the same `release` branch commit.
The owner identified the Odin jsmn parser as a port of upstream MIT jsmn; retain its attribution and inspect hosted adapter evidence.

`make test` builds/tests without requiring licensing texts. `make release-candidate` runs
those tests, then checks nonempty root LICENSE and NOTICE against this repository's
owner-set `LICENSE_SHA256` and `NOTICE_SHA256` variables (lowercase SHA-256),
embeds their exact bytes as `gams.license` and `gams.notice`, verifies them,
and stages a checksummed candidate. Changing either text requires renewed review
and updated digests. There is no approval boolean.

Branch CI without both digests still tests but does not upload binaries. A branch
with both digests fails closed if either text is missing or mismatched. Manual
release workflow dispatch on a branch verifies but never uploads or publishes.
The matching `v` tag from `version.txt` in `kkgams/plugin.respack`
triggers release only **after** owner review of the hosted Linux build and the
exact downloaded candidate. Never push a tag before that review; do not move a
failed tag. Tagged jobs fail before building when licensing is missing. Publication
rechecks digests and candidate bytes, requires the tag's commit to be the
current `release` branch head, refuses an existing GitHub Release, and refuses
to replace different bytes at the OCI tag. The OCI artifact is raw WASM,
not a package of licensing files; the GitHub Release includes LICENSE, NOTICE
and SHA256SUMS. Verify GHCR package permissions/visibility before tagging.

## Owner-operated sequence

1. Confirm the exact LICENSE/NOTICE bytes and linked inventory recorded in
   THIRD-PARTY-REVIEW.md and LICENSING.md before setting digest variables.
2. Set **repository-scoped Actions variables**, not secrets, independently for
   `kkgams/plugin.respack` (never copy another Unit's digests):

   ```sh
   gh variable set LICENSE_SHA256 -R kkgams/plugin.respack --body "$(shasum -a 256 LICENSE | cut -d ' ' -f 1)"
   gh variable set NOTICE_SHA256 -R kkgams/plugin.respack --body "$(shasum -a 256 NOTICE | cut -d ' ' -f 1)"
   ```

   The ephemeral `GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided by Actions; no personal token or
   other GitHub secret is requested by the workflow. A local release-candidate
   dry run needs `APPROVED_LICENSE_SHA256` and `APPROVED_NOTICE_SHA256` in its
   process environment with those same digests; CI maps the repository vars.
3. Push the reviewed `release` branch: `git push -u origin release`. Inspect
   `verify.yml` on GitHub for that exact commit, download its branch candidate,
   verify `SHA256SUMS` and embedded notice bytes, and review hosted Linux evidence.
   **A green build alone is not enough**: confirm the candidate was uploaded.
4. Manually run `release.yml` **on the branch** to exercise its release shell
   without publishing: `gh workflow run release.yml -R kkgams/plugin.respack --ref release`.
   For Lua, **both the branch candidate and this rehearsal** require the
   independent runtime E2E script; `make test`'s static checks are not enough.
5. Only when the branch candidate and hosted release-shell run have passed,
   check that `v$(cat version.txt)` has never been pushed, then tag exactly that
   verified commit and push **only that immutable tag**:

   ```sh
   git tag -a "v$(cat version.txt)" -m "plugin.respack $(cat version.txt)"
   git push origin "v$(cat version.txt)"
   ```

   The tag workflow verifies the tag points to the current `release` head but
   cannot know whether the owner inspected the prior candidate and rehearsal;
   **pushing the tag is the owner's explicit release decision** after those
   checks. Review the GitHub Release assets and GHCR raw WASM anonymously.
   If a pushed tag fails, fix the branch and use a new version; never retag.
